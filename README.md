## INTEREST IN IT

##### What is your interest in IT/ What makes IT interesting for you?
My interest in IT is derived in its growing presence in the business environment. As Information Technology is increasingly prevalent in the workplace, it is natural for me to learn how to best use it. This will help me learn how to use IT to streamline business processes, such as the implementation of enterprise systems.

##### When did your interest in IT start?
My interest in IT is relatively newfound. Before my current degree, I studied a Bachelor of Chiropractic science. Naturally, that degree did not do much with information technology. Since changing to a more suitable degree (Business), my interest from IT grew the desire to understand and best use the available technology.

##### Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
As aforementioned, my interest in IT sparked when I began my current degree. I realized how common the use of information technology is in the workplace. This unit (Introduction to IT) also consolidated some of my interest in the field, and I now realize how complex and significant it is.

##### Outline your IT experience (if any)
My experience with Information Technology is limited to the days I spent in high school. My interests back then were on the health sciences, so I was more drawn to Chemistry and Biology. As my goals have changed, so have my interests.

##### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
The first reason I chose to study with RMIT was because of the flexibility it offered me. Through browsing the different universities that provided logistics and supply chain education, RMIT stood out. The option to study online while staying back in Sydney was attractive. In addition, the university's reputation and rich history of providing education in the field of logistics and supply chain was a bonus. Furthermore, it has strong industry connections.

##### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
During my studies with RMIT, I expect to learn the theoretical aspects necessary to enter the field of logistics and supply chain management. I understand that to gather the knowledge I want, I also have to put in the work in, and that, I am willing to. 
RMIT is a great university with a long history in logistics and supply chain education. Its school of business IT and logistics has been operational for more than 20 years.

The position is for a Supply chain manager. Supply chain managers are individuals who manage the key components of supply chains. Their tasks include encouraging between sales and customer service departments, developing and maintain policies on general logistics and procedures, and maintaining the overall inventory based on demand. This position appeals to me because of its analytical and management nature. It will allow me to showcase my skills and ability in managing a supply chain.  

### Skills, qualifiations and experiences required 
The skills required for the job include project management, troubleshooting, and problem-solving, on top of others, such as understanding cost accounting, financial statements, e-business systems, cross-cultural issues, legal issues, and more. Supply chain managers are also expected to have excellent communication skills and time-management skills, as well as be proficient using programs such as Excel.  The position requires a relevant bachelor's degree, and to be efficient in the role, candidates often must have at least a minimum of 5 years of experience in a form of management, such as S&OP. 

### Skills, qualifications and experiences you currently have 
I am currently working towards a degree in Business, majoring in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. Although I possess certain skills required of a supply chain management candidate, these skills are not yet sharp and proficient enough. 

### Plan
My plan to reach my ideal job is to first complete my degree. In my final year of studies, I will find an internship to gain some practical experience. After graduating, I will apply for an entry-level job in the field, to gain further experience. I will then apply for a mid-level position a few years later, to consolidate my skills and increase my responsibilities. Once I feel confident, I will apply for a managerial position.

## PROFILE
### Myers-Briggs Test 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51509063/59564270-0d069d00-9088-11e9-92ab-8f0c7774fc68.png)

##### What do the results of the Myers Briggs test mean for me?
The Myers Briggs test indicated that I am an INTJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Judging). This means that I am an introvert (I), and energize by spending quiet time alone, I tend to be more reserved and thoughtful. The way I process information is intuitively (N) and will focus more on theories, patterns, and explanations. I may also be more concerned with the future than the present. Being a thinker (T), I make decisions with my head and are interested in finding the most logistical and reasonable choice. Lastly, being a judger (J), I appreciate structure and order, and like things to be planned ahead. 

##### How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
In a team, I think that being an INTJ would make me a good addition to a group. I am analytical and logical but do not like unpredictability. As a result, I would suggest everyone has set roles and responsibilities, and will frequently keep up to date on how the group is progressing. 

##### How should I take this into account when forming a team?
When forming a team, I should, if possible, seek like-minded individuals. If they are happy to break the workload into parts and work individually, discussing progress throughout the stages and sharing the work in the final stages to be approved of together, that is perhaps the best scenario.

### Learning Style Test

##### What do the results of the Learning style test mean for me?
Based on the learning style test, my learning type is visual. This means that I learn visually, and the use of visual aids will work to increase my ability to absorb and retain information. Because I am a visual learner, I will more likely take down notes rather than get involved in discussions. 

##### How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
As a visual learner, I may be less inclined to throw my thoughts verbally into a discussion, but rather take notes. I may also favor more visually appealing content. As a result, I may employ the use of images, and diagrams to organize information and communicate with other individuals in a team. 

##### How should I take this into account when forming a team?
When forming a team, I can work to capitalize on my learning style. For example, I may share my notes with other members and request that they use for visual cues. Furthermore, I will focus on creating notes and research concepts. Lastly, my learning style may differ from other individuals in a group. In such a case, we can discuss our thoughts to decipher if we perceived a certain concept from different angles. 

### Holland Test/ IIP RIASEC Markers 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51509063/59564280-2f001f80-9088-11e9-84c3-73331382cc8a.png)

##### What do the results of the Holland code careers test mean for me?
The Holland Codes career test results indicated that my personality code is CEI (Conventional, Enterprising, Investigative). This suggests I possess characteristics common with each of these personality types. For instance, Conventional types are detail oriented and organized, Enterprising types enjoy competitive environments and leadership roles, and Investigative types are analytical and intellectual. However, ascertaining from the first code, conventional, I am someone who enjoys working with data and details and likes to follow set procedures and routines. 

##### How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
In a team, my conventional component will want the group dynamics to be well defined. Expectations should be clearly conveyed, and members should know what part they will be responsible for. However, my enterprising component may want to take the lead and begin the project, or my investigative personality may enjoy more doing research and figuring out how to complete certain aspects. 

##### How should I take this into account when forming a team?
When forming a team, I may want to find other individuals who also want to set the expectations. I am also open to completing tasks initiated by others and may opt for a creative group. I also like to follow procedures and routines and may benefit from finding others with similar schedules.

## PROJECT IDEA 

##### What are you passionate about?
I am passionate about supply chain management and logistics. In addition, â€˜foodâ€™ is a topic that is relevant to every individual. As different restaurants are becoming increasingly popular, it is inevitable that there will be a need for an app to bring restaurants and diners closer. 

##### What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?
In the context of a project, I would like to see an app that gives users the ability to access all the information about a restaurant before choosing to dine there. Features such as the ability to access a full menu with images, and prices, in addition to the restaurants proximity from the user are features that will be greatly useful.

##### What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?
My ideal job is for a â€˜Supply chain managerâ€™. Although this project may not directly help me develop the skills, experience or knowledge required for my qualified job, it will inevitably be an interesting project. However, since it streamlines the process of bringing restauranteur and user one step closer, it can be perceived that I am facilitating the process of moving the food from restaurant to final customer. 

### Overview
The project will be a smartphone app called â€˜Food Near Meâ€™. Food Near Me is a food app that will bring restauranteurs and users one step closer. The app offers an array of features, such as information and deals from nearby restaurants.

Once the local restaurants are listed, images of the restaurant will act as the thumbnail, as well as to give users an indicative atmosphere. On the app, cuisine type, price range, and the restaurantâ€™s proximity to a user will also be displayed. Users will have access to full menus, as well as make table bookings on the app. 

### Motivation
The motivation behind Food Near Me is its usefulness to diners, in particular, individuals and couples who frequently dine out. The app's usefulness is mainly derived from its features, such as its ability and efficiency in providing users with the necessary information they want of a restaurant.

As these features are unprecedented, individuals in the past have been forced to enter a restaurant to get a feel of the atmosphere and prices and ended up dining there. And so, Food Near Me essentially prevents this and will give users a true image of a restaurant and what to expect before this occurs.

### Description 
â€˜Food Near Meâ€™ will be an app that incorporates many functions into one package. Its features include locating the user and suggesting nearby restaurants, a filtering option for users to choose between different cuisines, price ranges, and dietary needs. The app will also enable users to review and read reviews on the dishes and restaurants they are assessing. Restaurateurs may also promote their restaurant via the app. And an option to book tables on the app is also available. If the restaurant offers food delivery, the option will also be displayed.

Locating the user and suggesting nearby restaurants will work via GPS and will ask permission from the user beforehand. A list of all the available restaurants near the user will appear, based on a set radius. This radius can be modified to reduce or extend the distance from the user. Each section showing a restaurant will label how far the restaurant is from the user, its price range, cuisine type, and an image of the restaurant will be the thumbnail to show the user the expected atmosphere.  

The option to filter between different cuisines, price ranges and dietary needs is also available. Users may select between cuisines such as Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Greek, French, Thai, Spanish or Mediterranean. A restaurant can also be selected based on price ranges, such as $, $$, or $$$. The option for the user to set an upper and lower price limit will also be available. The dietary needs will also be covered, such as the Atkins diet, Ketogenic diet, Vegetarian diet, Vegan diet, and the Mediterranean diet as needed. If a specific option is not available, the app will show the user the friendliest restaurant for their dietary needs, and the best dishes to select. 

Reviewing and reading reviews will also be another feature of the app. Users can review dishes after they have consumed them, based on a 1 to 10 rating. The option to recommend the dish and comment on their thoughts is also possible. Other users can view these ratings and can then decide on whether a restaurant is for them.

Restaurants can also promote certain dishes, or the restaurant itself, via the app. Promotions include a percentage discount on dishes or a buy one get one free scenario can be employed. As users are increasingly seeking free and cheap food, such options will incentivize them to dine at the restaurant. Furthermore, a good track record of satisfied customers will work in favour of the restauranteur. This will ensure that restaurants ensure their food and service is top quality. 

Furthermore, users can book a table via the app, where they may select a day and time slot. The restauranteur will confirm their booking as soon as they receive the request. The user will thereafter receive a message notification on the app to confirm their booking. And lastly, if a restaurant offers food delivery, this option will also be displayed on the restaurant thumbnail and in the details when the user selects the restaurant in the app.

### Tools and technologies 
Firstly, the software component consists of an app programming language, a designing tool, and an emulator. A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Examples include Java, C, C++, Corona, PhoneGap, Titanium, and HTML 5. 

And an emulator/app testing tool is one that allows a host device to act like a guest device. This enables the host system to run software designed for the guest system. Examples of emulators are the Google Android emulator, the official Android SDK emulator, Mobione, and eggplant. Examples of open source tools include Android (for Android), and XCode (for iOS). 

### Skills required 
The skills necessary for this project include product management skills, design skills, writing skills, QA and performance testing skills, coding skills, cross-platform skills, and data skills. Given my inexperience with information technology, I do not currently possess these skills. 

Although seeking the resources to learn these skills may not be difficult, given the time constraints, they are relatively out of reach. The software component will include emulators, designing tools, and app programming languages. And hardware, excluding a mobile device and computer, may extend further, requiring a sizable amount of capital. Hence, building such an app is not feasible.

### Outcome 
The original problem stemmed from how difficult it was to get information on a restaurant a user wanted unless stepping into a restaurant. This resulted in diners entering mediocre restaurants or decent restaurants but with high expectations and left disappointed. What Food Near Me essentially does is mitigate this. 

It provides the same information a user would get from walking into a restaurant, all from the comfort of their mobile device. On the app, the user will have access to full menus, including images, prices, and ratings. The impact of this is that users will know what to expect when they walk into a restaurant.
